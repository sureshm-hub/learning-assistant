# Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are the three main types.

# Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data. Examples include regression and classification algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

# Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning involves working with unlabeled data to identify patterns. Examples include clustering algorithms like k-means and hierarchical clustering.

# Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Examples include Q-learning and deep Q-networks (DQN).

# Neural Networks
A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process input data. The backpropagation algorithm helps in adjusting weights to minimize loss.

# Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI focused on enabling computers to understand and process human language. It includes tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text summarization.

# Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Support vector machines are supervised learning models used for classification and regression. They work by finding the hyperplane that best separates data points in different categories.

# Decision Trees
A decision tree is a flowchart-like model used for decision-making. It splits data into branches based on conditions, making it useful for classification and regression tasks.

# Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize loss functions in machine learning models. It iteratively updates model parameters to find the optimal solution.
